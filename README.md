# Intro
The language of this project is Typescript.
This project renders physical values (like mass, temperature) as declared variables and means of their presentation and conversion.

One one hand it's a library of such units with routines, and on the other - table of aircraft specs, presenting these features.

## Disclaimer

It was my first trial of Angular/Typescript and not the sure not the best (my native language is C#).  
Any rational critic would be highly appreciated.  
As well i had to dive in into the VS Code, npm, node.js. Um, now i gotta appreciate much more Visual Studio -Code- and Resharper.

## What you get
a) natively looking declaration of physical values:  see SOURCE DATA
e.g. const 
b) uval service
c) uval pipe, that allows to convert "on the fly"

## What you may give
There's not enough tests but any and each ultimate user is encouraged to cover the library with own tests. That would be safer and independent when the consumer tests the thing.

## Open points

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Lessons learned
Dunno forget to commit and to back-up
