## Disclaimer
This hobby part-time project was my first dive into Angular/Typescript (my *native* language for the last decade has been C#). Along with deeper than "hello world" experience with VS Code, GitHub, npm, markdown.

# Physical units for Typescript
This Angular project is about physical values like mass, temperature. It renders their smooth declaration, presentation and conversion.\

Hope, these code snippets will speak better:
```typescript
const nextStation = meter(300)

process(TheEarth.Mass.Tonne)

let myKittenWeight: mass
myKittenWeight = kilogram(3)
```

## Deeper dive
One one hand it's a library of such units with routines, and on the other - table of aircraft specifications, presenting these features.\

b) uval service
c) uval pipe, that actually is a pipe for uval

## Behind the scenes
Type safety
Casting (ToDo: tests)
performance

## How to get in 

## Postnotes
Any rational critic would be highly appreciated. As well as cooperation ("many hands make light work").


There're not enough tests but any ultimate user is encouraged to cover the library with own tests. That would be safer and more independent than in-built tests.
