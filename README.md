# Intro
The language of this project is Typescript.
This project renders physical values (like mass, temperature) as declared variables and means of their presentation and conversion.
One one hand it's a library of such units with routines, and on the other - table of aircraft specs, presenting these features.

## Disclaimer

It was my first trial of Angular/Typescript and not the sure not the best (my native language is C#). Any rational critic would be highly appreciated.
There's not enough tests but any and each ultimate user is encouraged to cover the library with own tests. That would be safer and. 

## What you get
a) a library 
b) uval pipe
c) uval service

## Open points

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
