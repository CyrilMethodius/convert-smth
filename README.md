# Intro
This Angular project began in 2020 as a hobby dive into Angular/Typescript along with VS Code, GitHub, npm. <sup>**_i**</sup>

It's all about physical values (like temperature, distance, mass), their declaration, presenation, conversion. It's really a big challenge <sup>**_n**</sup>

**It's not an overall solution but rather groundwork of a framework**

<sub><sup>**_i**</sup> Nevertheless i'm since 1990s in IT (from deep backend to far frontend) and for the recent decade my *native* language has been amazing **C#**</sub>\
<sub><sup>**_i**</sup> even ridd off of quantum physics</sub>

# U(nit)Values, or physical values, for Typescript
Let's intrigue you with just a tiny subsets of snippets 
```typescript
const nextStation = meter(300)

publish(TheEarth.Mass.Tonne)

let tempo: velocity
tempo = camera1.flash(yourCar)
```
When you liked it, then please [snippets]()

If you event liked that, then some concepts behind:
+ uniform declaration
+ presentation
+ conversion
+ ops (under construction)

## Coming next
### Math operations
I'm thinking on the syntax meanwhile - both TS and JS don't facilitate overload of arithmetic ops (like '+'). All the same - too dubios for physical units, consider: 
```typescript 
let cargoTotal: mass 
cargoTotal = tone(4) - kilogram(90); cargoSum += pound(200) // what unit shall be derived here
```
## Deeper dive
One one hand it's a library of such units with routines, and on the other - table of aircraft specifications, presenting these features.

b) uval service
c) uval pipe, that actually is a pipe for uval


## Get started

Build the library and the project

## ToDos
Validating a unit against a natural range (say, Kelvin scale begins of zero <sup>4</sup>)
Floating point calculation
preventing camel calculation jumps

VALIDATOR for RANGEs: BOTH BUILT IN AND CUSTOM (see footnote)
