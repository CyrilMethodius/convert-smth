## Actual ToDos
Search the code for ToDos

## Ranges and validation
My first intention was to have build in range proof in *measurables*.
Distance and mass by their nature can't be negative and zero Kelvin is absolute minus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>0</sup>

## Calculation

### Floating point

### Preventing camel or zigzag calculation
preventing "camel" calculation jumps, i.e. when a tiny is multiplicated with very big and then again wih a tiny one

### Caching

## Ideas
### Smth better than ng-build-in decimal pipe
