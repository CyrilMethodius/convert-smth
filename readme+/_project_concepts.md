## Glossary
+ [Unit](../src/app/components/units/avia/aircrafts/aircrafts-descr-table/aircrafts-descr-table.component.html) - physical measure or scale (e.g. Fahrenheit)
+ Measureable - concept of a physical property, which has *value* and its *unit* 
+ UValue (aka *uvalue*, *uval*, *UnitValue*) - derivative of Measureable, i.e. physical value, like mass, temperature, acceleration

## How conversion works
Conversion between differing units of the same nature (measure) is the heart of this framework.
Basically there're too approaches 
+ tabled (rational, reverse)
+ functional (mostly reverse)

### Functional


## Validation and ranges


## Universal values
Physics is our life and even the worst schooler is aware of dozens of event-related, universal, notable or named physical properties (but not exactly their values): 
+ water freezing/boiling, speed of sound/light 
+ mt. Everest height, length of equator, distance to Mars
+ normal human body temperature, home/auto voltage
+ Newtonian constant of gravitation, Boltzmann constant

### Solution
Library of such values

## Arithmetics
